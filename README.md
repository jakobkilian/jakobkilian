## Collections / Projects
An overview of important projects. Use the links (↗) to find the repositories

### Unfolding Space [↗](https://github.com/stars/jakobkilian/lists/unfolding-space)
_The Unfolding Space Glove is an experimental Open Source wearable that allows blind or visually impaired users to haptically sense the depth of their surrounding space and thus (hopefully) better navigate through it._

This project ran from about 2018 to 2022, being my bachelor _and_ master thesis and ending in an empirical study being published in a well-cited paper in 2022. Also check out the [website](http://unfoldingspace.org/) for more links to videos and the paper.
### Interfacing UR3 Robotic Arms ↗
_Universal OSC/MQTT Interface for the UR3 and insights and findings of experiments I conducted with UR3 robot arms_

Controlling a Universal Robots UR3 is far from trivial, especially when it comes to performing smooth, real-time movements based on sensor input. In addition to the inherent complexity of programming crash-free 3D movement UR lacks proper documentation and sometimes provides buggy installers. I wondered why there wasn't a universal interface that could be used to remotely control the robot from any programming language and any device via network. So I build this OSC/MQTT bridge to connect the robot with e.g. python, MaxMSP, Processing or others.
### Interactive Systems Courses at KISD, Cologne [↗](https://github.com/KISDinteractive)
_Teaching format at the intersection of **AI and design**, starting with the basics of coding and computing and progressing to machine learning and deployment on microcontrollers._

From 2022 to 2025, I worked at the Cologne International School of Design in Cologne, Germany, as part of the joint research project [KITeGG](https://www.gestaltung.ai/en). Together with my colleague, Eduard Paal, I developed a basic programming and computer science course for designers, as well as two follow-up courses on Arduino programming and Tiny Machine Learning.
