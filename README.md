## Hi! I'm Jakob

I am Interaction Designer, Creative Technologist, Researcher, Maker and Musician based in Cologne, Germany.
As even I sometimes forget all the things I'm working on, and Github tends to get messy, here's an overview.

There is also my [(design) portfolio](https://www.jakobkilian.de) and my [music on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/praqma).

From 2022 to 2025 I worked at Köln International School of Design (Köln, Germany) as part of the joint research project KITeGG. With my colleague Eduard Paal, I developed teaching formats on the intersect of **AI and Design** starting with a basic course on programming and computing for designers and ending with a more advanced session where we trained small models from scratch that could run on microcontrollers.
