## Projects
An overview of important projects. Use the links (↗) to find the repositories

### Unfolding Space [↗](https://github.com/stars/jakobkilian/lists/unfolding-space)
_The Unfolding Space Glove is an experimental Open Source wearable that allows blind or visually impaired users to haptically sense the depth of their surrounding space and thus (hopefully) better navigate through it._
This project ran from about 2018 to 2022, being my bachelor _and_ master thesis and ending in an empirical study being published in a well-cited paper in 2022. Also check out the [website](http://unfoldingspace.org/) for more links to videos and the paper.
### Interactive Systems Courses at KISD, Cologne[↗](https://github.com/KISDinteractive)
_Teaching format at the intersection of **AI and design**, starting with coding and computing basics and progressing to tiny machine learning and deployment on microcontrollers._
From 2022 to 2025, I worked at the Cologne International School of Design (Cologne, Germany) as part of the joint research project [KITeGG](https://www.gestaltung.ai/en). Together with my colleague Eduard Paal, we developed a basic course on programming and computer science for designers, as well as two follow-up courses on Arduino programming and Tiny Machine Learning.
